Note: Date sorted from newest to oldest  (M/D/Y). Version number period symbol means
a sub-version (like a chapter number), NOT a decimal point (goes like this 1.8, 1.9,
1.10... and not 1.8, 1.9 2.0...).

3/27/2019 -2.3
 -Removed several JSL !Defines in subroutinecode.asm and converted them to jump to the routines
  directly since both codes and labels are in the same file and ASAR won't error out saying
  label not found.
 -Improved the readme on how to insert this patch.
 -Added a tutorial on how to insert routines that uses freeram defines of potentially other patches.'
 -Patching now display the memory statistics and how many subroutines was added, useful for debugging.
4/26/2018 - improved rats tags, v2.2
 -Realized that the defines assumes the JML starts directly where
  the rats tags start, causing the first two subroutine to be
  invalid (can crash the game) as they never actually point to
  the actual JML list.
 -In addition to that, I've talk to MarioFanGamer (ID:22951)
  that when using freespace in banks $10 or higher, so I
  implemented a check to not include the rats tag when banks $0F
  or lower.
 -Fixed various issues that this WASN'T TESTED AT ALL, this
  mainly includes an undefined define "!SlotsUsed" preventing
  the patch to be inserted.
 -Defines files are moved to a subfolder of this package to keep
  things organized as well as making defines for other patches/3rd party code
  to use the shared subroutines patch a cinch (you only copy the folder containing
  the defines).

4/25/2018 - rats tags, v2.1
 -Added rats tags.

4/7/2018 to 4/8/2018- imamelia + GHB update, v2.0
 -imamelia:
 --Recoded to work with Asar (Xkas is outdated)
 --Routines are now documented, making usage much easier for user who don't know
   how the routine works.
 --The definition file now uses macros that assigns the label names to the defines,
   making it easier to edit them.
 -GreenHammerBro
 --Added a readme instruction on how to use and documentation on potential errors
   that can happen.
 --Added SA-1 support to most subroutines (some of them aren't compatible because
   either they uses the SNES registers, codes uses unsigend multiplication/division
   while SA-1 only provides signed version, etc.)
   
6/22/2011 v1.01
 -First release.
