<center><h1>Shared Subroutines Patch</h1></center>
<center><h2>Created and updated by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=3471">imamelia</a>
and supported by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=18802">GreenHammerBro.</a></h2></center>

What this patch does is enable you to have &ldquo;universal availability&rdquo; subroutines
accessible anywhere in your ROM, and also by other third-party patches/code without the need to
have duplicate codes that can waste space in your game. The reason for this patch is because
patches commonly needs a freespace (in the olden days when xkas was popular, you have to
manually set them up, and Asar automatically finds those freespace), thus the code themselves
have varying locations and isn't safe to have other things call that moving subroutine each
time the user re-patches them.<br><br>

It works by having a list of <kbd>JML</kbd>s in a <i>fixed location</i>. Those <kbd>JML</kbd>s then
jumps to a freespace block. To call those subroutines anywhere, you <kbd>JSL</kbd> to that <kbd>JML</kbd>
list instead of the freespace. Each time you patch, only the <kbd>JML</kbd> jump destination and
the subroutine itself can change, while the <kbd>JML</kbd> themselves stay at the same place. This renders
the subroutine jump to be stable and won't suddenly jump into now-deleted code which can crash your game.

<h2>How to use</h2>
If you want to port your codes that uses !defines natively (or defines used exclusively in the routine)
to the shared subroutines patch (some patches uses subroutines), see <a name="RoutinePort" href="Readme_Files/RoutinePorting.html">this information</a>
on how to do so.
<ol>
<li>Open <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> and on the very bottom after the last subroutine, create your routine,
here is a simple example:
<table><tr><td><pre>MyRoutine123:
	;Sets current player's lives to 99.
	LDA.b #98 ;>In SMW's lives system, the value stored in memory is -1 from displayed (if HUD says 5, its #$04)
	STA $0DBE|!addr
	RTL
</pre></td></tr></table>
</li>
<li>Next, create an <kbd>autoclean JML RoutineMainLabel</kbd> on the list entry like so:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
autoclean JML LoseYoshi				; make Yoshi run away
autoclean JML MyRoutine123			;>This new routine
JMLListEnd: ;>The byte-address +1 from the last byte. ;>Don't items after this label, otherwise stuff past here is not protected by RATS.
</pre></td></tr></table>
</li>
<li>And if you want to call this routine from third-party resources, like from blocks, sprites, patches, uberasm tool, etc,
you must define the &ldquo;label defines&rdquo; by copying the folder <kbd>SharedSub_Defines</kbd> and call
that using the incsrc command in asm files that calls the <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd>'s routines:
<table><tr><td><pre>incsrc "SharedSub_Defines/SubroutineDefs.asm"
	;[...]
	JSL !MyRoutine123</pre></td></tr></table>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Workings documentation</h2>
Each subroutine holds these items:
<ul>
<li>Label &#x2194; definition files:</li>
<ul><li><kbd>sharedsub.asm</kbd> which holds the JML list. Format: <kbd>autoclean JML SubroutineName</kbd></li><br>
<li><kbd>subroutinedefs.asm</kbd> which is the definition file. The subroutine labels gets assigned to
the definition name (thus, using <kbd>SubroutineName</kbd> as a label for your subroutine, the definition
to access this subroutine is <kbd>!SubroutineName</kbd>, you simply call using <kbd>JSL !SubroutineName</kbd>).
This is because Asar (or other patching tools) is unaware of what is installed inside the ROM, so it cannot obtain the locations
of the start of the routines.
</li></ul><br>
Be aware that the order of the JML list in <kbd>sharedsub.asm</kbd> and the defines list in <kbd>SubroutineDefs.asm</kbd> must match,
for example:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
autoclean JML SubroutineName
autoclean JML AnotherSubroutineExample</pre></td></tr></table><br>

means that in the definition file, it needs to be ordered like this:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
%SetDefine(SubroutineName)
%SetDefine(AnotherSubroutineExample)</pre></td></tr></table><br>

and not this:
<table><tr><td><pre><font color="red">;[...]
%SetDefine(AnotherSubroutineExample)
%SetDefine(SubroutineName)</font></pre></td></tr></table><br>

Because then the labels gets assigned to the wrong define(s). The defines are operated in a loop that each define label
contain an address that are incremented by 4 bytes (because the instruction <kbd>JML $xxxxxx</kbd> takes 4 bytes) instead
of extracting the labels to obtain their list position, which is impossible.<br><br>

If you change <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>'s address, then patch again, it does not remove the old JML list, you have to manually
erase them using either a debugger or a hex editor. This is because the list itself stored in the ROM must be at a fixed
location.<br><br>

<li><kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> holds the subroutine code itself. Format:
<table><tr><td><pre>SubroutineName:
&lt;Code here&gt;
;ends using an RTL, not RTS.</pre></td></tr></table></li><br>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be very careful to avoid having label duplicates (i.e &ldquo;redefined label&rdquo;), as asar would error out saying that
they are redefined. This likely happens when you add a new routine that does not use sublabels. To avoid this, edit the code to
use it (number of &ldquo;.&rdquo;s before the name of the sublabel) or +/- (have them repeated should one jumps over another
(example: <kbd>BRA ++</kbd> to branch downards to the first <kbd>++</kbd>)).</li><br>

<li>It is safe to call a routine within a routine, since they are in the same patch (Asar knows the labels within <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd>,
so you won't get error saying &ldquo;label not found&rdquo;) because multiples files connected via <kbd>incsrc</kbd>), you can simply call the
subroutine without using a define (<kbd>JSL SubroutineName</kbd> instead of <kbd>JSL !SubroutineName</kbd> to save a few cycles, since you don't
have to jump to a JML in the JML list, then back into the routine code)</li><br>

<li>Due to how the SNES banks work, if you have a very large code in <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> and/or a large JML list (the limit is 16,384
JMLs if you were to place the list at the start of the bank (address $xx0000) that is completely empty and not using banks $10-$7F and $90-$FF) that would
exceed $10000 bytes (a full bank), asar errors out saying a bank border have been crossed. To fix this, simply
use <kbd>freecode</kbd> command near the area (between two subroutines, data, or table, not during that area) that is about
to cross the border. This will make the section after <kbd>freecode</kbd> use a different freespace location.
You may have to use this code just in case since the bank value doesn't get updated and you're using a
16-bit table addressing:

<table><tr><td><pre>	PHB		;>Preserve bank into stack
	PHK		;>Push current bank
	PLB		;>Pull out as current bank
	;[...]		;>code that would need a correct bank
	PLB
	;[...]</pre></td></tr></table><br>

<li>When selecting a location (by setting <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>) to insert your JML list, if you pick an area in banks <kbd>$10</kbd> or
higher, the 8-byte RATS tag will be included (RATS tag is at <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>, and 8 bytes after the starting byte is the actual
JML list (don't worry, the define also adjust 8 bytes to align with the JML location)).</li>
</li>
</ul>
