<center><h1>Shared Subroutines Patch</h1></center>
<center><h2>Created and updated by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=3471">imamelia</a>
and supported by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=18802">GreenHammerBro.</a></h2></center>

What this patch does is enable you to have &ldquo;universal availability&rdquo; subroutines
accessible anywhere in your ROM, and also by other third-party patches/code without the need to
have duplicate codes that can waste space in your game. The reason for this patch is because
patches commonly needs a freespace (in the olden days when xkas was popular, you have to
manually set them up, and Asar automatically finds those freespace), thus the code themselves
have varying locations and isn't safe to have other things call that moving subroutine each
time the user re-patches them.<br><br>

It works by having a list of <kbd>JML</kbd>s in a <i>fixed location</i>. Those <kbd>JML</kbd>s then
jumps to a freespace block. To call those subroutines anywhere, you <kbd>JSL</kbd> to that <kbd>JML</kbd>
list instead of the freespace. Each time you patch, only the <kbd>JML</kbd> jump destination and
the subroutine itself can change, while the <kbd>JML</kbd> themselves stay at the same place. This renders
the subroutine jump to be stable and won't suddenly jump into now-deleted code which can crash your game.
<h2>What you need</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=4611">Slogger</a> (recommended, but a debugger will also work if you find data filled with zeroes or <kbd>FF<kbd>s)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open <kbd>SharedSub_Defines/SubroutineDefs.asm</kbd>, and here, you see a define <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>, this is the address to place your JML list (comes with an 8-byte RATS
tag preceding if needed). Using slogger, you want to make sure that this define points to the <b>beginning</b> location of the freespace (that is big enough), you don't want to
inadvertently place the list at an area that would overwrite other codes. To find freespace, use slogger (drop your game file on the exe). Mine may look different from yours:
<table><tr><td><pre>C:\Users\RedBro\Desktop\smw romhacking\Submission\shared_sub\a.smc
headered
ROM is 0x100000 bytes long

PC offset		LoROM offset		Size

0x0812C4		0x1090C4		0x6F34
0x090200		0x128000		0x8000
0x098200		0x138000		0x8000
0x0A0200		0x148000		0x8000

0x0F0200		0x1E8000		0x8000

A total of 0x6EF34 bytes of free space were found
IMPORTANT: The "LoROM Offset" is what is entered in xkas as free space
</pre></td></tr></table>

Now what you must pay attention to <kbd>LoROM Offset</kbd> and the <kbd>size</kbd>, LoROM offset
is the starting SNES memory location that is empty, and size the number of bytes. Because each
JML instruction is 4 bytes long (1 byte for the opcode alone, 3 for the address), the formula of how much space you would need is:
<table><tr><td><pre>BytesTaken = RatsSpace + (NumberOfJMLs * 4)

;RatsSpace:
; = 0 if you have !FreespaceU be at banks $00-$0F or $80-$8F
; = 8 otherwise ($10-$7F or $90-$FF).</pre></td></tr></table>

In case you don't know, a bank is a byte of the leftmost (or highest) 8-bit value of a 24-bit address: the XX in
$XXyyyy.<br><br>

With the example above, I choose <kbd>$128000</kbd> (so I set <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd> to that address number), now look at the left two hex
digits, that is bank $12, and if you haven't added any new routines or remove any, the number of bytes the JML list takes is
<kbd>208 = 8 + (50 * 4)</kbd>. Therefore the address range would be  $128000 to $1280CF. Assuming you are an average user, I recommend picking a freespace that is at least $4000 (16384 decimal) bytes large.

</li>
<li>Open <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> and on the very bottom after the last subroutine, create your routine,
here is a simple example:
<table><tr><td><pre>MyRoutine123:
	;Sets current player's lives to 99.
	LDA.b #98 ;>In SMW's lives system, the value stored in memory is -1 from displayed (if HUD says 5, its #$04)
	STA $0DBE|!addr
	RTL
</pre></td></tr></table>
</li>
<li>Next, create an <kbd>autoclean JML RoutineMainLabel</kbd> on the JML list entry like so:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
autoclean JML LoseYoshi				; make Yoshi run away
autoclean JML MyRoutine123			;>This new routine
JMLListEnd: ;>The byte-address +1 from the last byte. ;>Don't items after this label, otherwise stuff past here is not protected by RATS.
</pre></td></tr></table>
Now run Asar to insert the routines package into your game.
</li><br>
<li>To call this routine from third-party resources, like from blocks, sprites, patches, uberasm tool, etc,
you must define the &ldquo;label defines&rdquo; by copying the folder <kbd>SharedSub_Defines</kbd> and call
that using the incsrc command in asm files that calls the <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd>'s routines:
<table><tr><td><pre>incsrc "SharedSub_Defines/SubroutineDefs.asm"
	;[...]
	JSL !MyRoutine123</pre></td></tr></table>
</li>
</ol>
If you want to port your codes that uses !defines natively (or defines used exclusively in the routine)
to the shared subroutines patch (many patches uses subroutines), see <a name="RoutinePort" href="Readme_Files/RoutinePorting.html">this information</a>
on how to do so.

<h2>Workings documentation</h2>
Each subroutine holds these items:
<ul>
<li>Label &#x2194; definition files:</li>
<ul><li><kbd>sharedsub.asm</kbd> which holds the JML list. Format: <kbd>autoclean JML SubroutineName</kbd></li><br>
<li><kbd>subroutinedefs.asm</kbd> which is the definition file. The subroutine labels gets assigned to
the definition name (thus, using <kbd>SubroutineName</kbd> as a label for your subroutine, the definition
to access this subroutine is <kbd>!SubroutineName</kbd>, you simply call using <kbd>JSL !SubroutineName</kbd>).
This is because Asar (or other patching tools) is unaware of what is installed inside the ROM, so it cannot obtain the locations
of the start of the routines.
</li></ul><br>
Be aware that the order of the JML list in <kbd>sharedsub.asm</kbd> and the defines list in <kbd>SubroutineDefs.asm</kbd> must match (this includes
not to have missing defines on a JML item that does exist, and vice versa),
for example:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
autoclean JML SubroutineName
autoclean JML AnotherSubroutineExample</pre></td></tr></table><br>

means that in the definition file, it needs to be ordered like this:
<table><tr><td><pre>;[...]
%SetDefine(SubroutineName)
%SetDefine(AnotherSubroutineExample)</pre></td></tr></table><br>

and not this:
<table><tr><td><pre><font color="red">;[...]
%SetDefine(AnotherSubroutineExample)
%SetDefine(SubroutineName)</font></pre></td></tr></table><br>

And this:
<table><tr>
<td><pre>autoclean JML FindFreeUploadSlot
autoclean JML GetRand2
<font color="red">autoclean JML RangedRandomRt</font> ;>Not assigned to define.
autoclean JML ChangeMap16
autoclean JML FindMap16ActsLike
autoclean JML FindMap16TileNum
autoclean JML SubGetItemMemory
;[...]</pre></td>

<td><pre>!FindFreeUploadSlot = JMLListStart	;>The first JML doesn't get a macro so that it doesn't skip 4 bytes after "JMLListStart".
%SetDefine(GetRand2)
<font color="yellow">%SetDefine(ChangeMap16)</font>			;>Gets assigned to [RangedRandomRt]
<font color="yellow">%SetDefine(FindMap16ActsLike)</font>		;>Gets assigned to [ChangeMap16]
<font color="yellow">%SetDefine(FindMap16TileNum)</font>		;>Gets assigned to [FindMap16ActsLike]
<font color="yellow">%SetDefine(SubGetItemMemory)</font>		;>Gets assigned to [FindMap16TileNum]
;[...]</pre></td>
</tr></table>

Because then the labels gets assigned to the wrong define(s).<br><br>

What actually happens is that defines are being assigned to a JML manually; its guessed via taking the first JML address and adds by 4 for each
define through a macro being called without regards to the actual JML list (Asar cannot &ldquo;extract&rdquo; the list to find out what defines
correspond to what define). Thus the defines are being independent, each subsequent subroutine define means the next JML list item, regardless
of its label name nor its define.<br><br>

If you change <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>'s address, then patch again, it does not remove the old JML list, you have to manually
erase them using either a debugger or a hex editor. This is because the list itself stored in the ROM must be at a fixed
location being defined by <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>, so Asar cannot magically know that previous spot location.<br><br>

<li><kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> holds the subroutine code itself. Format:
<table><tr><td><pre>SubroutineName:
&lt;Code here&gt;
;ends using an RTL, not RTS.</pre></td></tr></table></li><br>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be very careful to avoid having label duplicates (i.e &ldquo;redefined label&rdquo;), as asar would error out saying that
they are redefined. This likely happens when you add a new routine that does not use sublabels. To avoid this, edit the code to
use it (number of &ldquo;.&rdquo;s before the name of the sublabel) or +/- (have them repeated should one jumps over another
(example: <kbd>BRA ++</kbd> to branch downards to the first <kbd>++</kbd>)).</li><br>

<li>It is safe to call a routine within a routine, since they are in the same patch (Asar knows the labels within <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd>,
so you won't get error saying &ldquo;label not found&rdquo;) because multiples files connected via <kbd>incsrc</kbd>), you can simply call the
subroutine without using a define (<kbd>JSL SubroutineName</kbd> instead of <kbd>JSL !SubroutineName</kbd> to save a few cycles, since you don't
have to jump to a JML in the JML list, then back into the routine code)</li><br>

<li>Due to how the SNES bank borders work, if you have a very large code in <kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd> and/or a large JML list (the limit is 8192
JMLs if you were to place the list at the start of the bank (address $xx0000) that is completely empty and not using banks $10-$7F and $90-$FF) that would
exceed $*000 bytes (a full bank is actually $10000 bytes big, but only half is used in the ROM), asar errors out saying a bank border have
been crossed. To fix this, simply use <kbd>freecode</kbd> command near the area (between two subroutines, data, or table, not during that area) that is about
to cross the border. This will make the section after <kbd>freecode</kbd> use a different freespace location.
You may have to use this code just in case since the bank value doesn't get updated and you're using a
16-bit table addressing:

<table><tr><td><pre>	PHB		;>Preserve bank into stack
	PHK		;>Push current bank
	PLB		;>Pull out as current bank
	;[...]		;>code that would need a correct bank
	PLB		;>Restore bank.
	;[...]		;>In case if you wanted code here that doesn't need current bank.</pre></td></tr></table><br>

<li>When selecting a location (by setting <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>) to insert your JML list, if you pick an area in banks <kbd>$10</kbd> or
higher, the 8-byte RATS tag will be included (RATS tag is at <kbd>!FreespaceU</kbd>, and 8 bytes after the starting byte is the actual
JML list (don't worry, the define also adjust 8 bytes to align with the JML location)).</li>
</li><br>

<li>If you experience weird glitches or a crash when you patch a third-party freespace patch, then re-apply this patch, its likely that the previous patch before this
must've been placed a freespace code after the JML list of this patch, then gets overwritten by the expanded JML list. A simple fix is to create placeholder JMLs
(they're just empty routines that just exist so that in the future, you can replace it to be an actual routine) on the list so that other freespace-required
patches don't &ldquo;cut in line&rdquo; of the JML list, here is what I mean:
<table><tr><td><pre>;Make sure the list ends with nth number of these, and not to have actual routines after if you're not going to have these defined,
;else you would assign the defines to the wrong label.
autoclean JML Placeholder
autoclean JML Placeholder
autoclean JML Placeholder
autoclean JML Placeholder
autoclean JML Placeholder
;[...] ;>expand this as many as you would expect how many routines you would need.
JMLListEnd: ;>The byte-address +1 from the last byte.</pre></pre></td></tr></table></li>

<kbd>subroutinecode.asm</kbd>:
<table><tr><td><pre>PlaceHolder:
	RTL;>A blank subroutine that just exist (you only need to have this code exist once).</pre></pre></td></tr></table></li><br>

<li>The information displayed on the Asar console window when patching is whats actually inserted into the ROM, not based on defines. So if you have more items in
the defines than on the JML list, that won't do anything to the game, nor the display (you probably want the number of entries in both lists to be equal anyways).</li>
</ul>
