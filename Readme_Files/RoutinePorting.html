<center><h1>Porting Subroutines with defines to the shared subroutines patch.</h1></center>

<ol>
<li>Perhaps you want to move this simple example code to the shared subroutines patch:
<table><tr><td><pre>!Define0 = $60
!Define1 = $61
!Define2 = $62
!Define3 = $63


MyRoutine123:
	LDA #$01
	STA !Define0
	LDA #$02
	STA !Define1
	LDA #$03
	STA !Define2
	LDA #$04
	STA !Define3
	RTL</pre></td></tr></table>
Pretty simple! just copy the whole thing, making sure nothing unrelated modifies the values in the defines in between whats sets them (top) and the codes that uses them
(this happens if 2 or more patches happens to have defines with the same name, like for example, player HP is defined <kbd>!Health = $60</kbd> and a sprite using the same
define, <kbd>!Health = $7C</kbd>).
Of course, the same applies if the defines are in a separate file and uses <kbd>incsrc "&lt;path&gt;"</kbd> (includes &ldquo;source file&rdquo;)<br><br>

defines.asm:
<table><tr><td><pre>!Define0 = $60
!Define1 = $61
!Define2 = $62
!Define3 = $63</pre></td></tr></table><br><br>

AnotherDefinesFile.asm:
<table><tr><td><pre>!AnotherDefine0 = $7C
!AnotherDefine1 = $87</pre></td></tr></table><br>

Routine code:
<table><tr><td><pre>incsrc "defines.asm"
incsrc "AnotherDefinesFile.asm" ;>In the case you have an ASM resource with defines being in different ASM files.
MyRoutine123:
	LDA #$01
	STA !Define0
	LDA #$02
	STA !Define1
	LDA #$03
	STA !Define2
	LDA #$04
	STA !Define3
	
	LDA !AnotherDefine0
	CLC
	ADC #$05
	STA !AnotherDefine0
	
	LDA !AnotherDefine1
	SEC
	SBC #$05
	STA !AnotherDefine1
	RTL</pre></td></tr></table>
If you have another subroutine that uses the same defines as the other, place the defines or the &ldquo;include source&rdquo; before ALL (on top) of them so you don't get errors.</li><br>

<li>However, not all patches have conveniently named defines, resulting variables in them to be altered when they get redefined, often when two unrelated codes use the same
define, for example: just <kbd>!Health</kbd> is set to be a value of <kbd>$60</kbd>, another and later <kbd>!Health</kbd> is set to <kbd>$0F3A</kbd>. As asar process the ASM files in a sequential analysis,
<kbd>!Health</kbd> will contain a value of whats last sets it every time. With such a name, this is bad as that the naming term could be used for completely different purposes (is this for enemy or player?
Better to use name terms like <kbd>!RAM_PlayerHealth</kbd> and <kbd>!RAM_EnemyHealth</kbd>. To fix this issue,
its best to edit their defines in their original ASM file (and in the defines file if present), then move them to here (so you don't accidentally edit other existing codes in the shared patch).
If multiple ASM files and/or resources intentionally use the same define name (often with the same default value), such as the ground pound patch and a block in the blocks section that
interacts with ground pound, make sure ALL of them are renamed for a more specific term.<br><br>

Renaming the defines can easily be done using a text editor of your choice (I recommend using notepad++) and replace (CTRL+H), then carefully replace all of them by pressing &ldquo;replace&rdquo;
(I recommend replacing one at a time and paying attention to how it is highlighted, not to be recommended to &ldquo;replace all&rdquo; for a fast edit because the &ldquo;find&rdquo; mechanism
may find sequence of characters within a different define, like searching for &ldquo;<kbd>!Freeram_test</kbd>&rdquo; could point to <kbd><u>!Freeram_test</u>2</kbd> when you are looking for
just <kbd>!Freeram_test</kbd>).</li>
